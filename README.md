# Open Data Platform

Open Data Platform is a Data Engineering project for my own educational purposes.
It essentially is a data pipeline starting with data extraction from public sources such as the OpenWeather API.
The end-goal is to deliver analysable data in the best way possible. Altough I will probably analyse the data myself within the project later on.
